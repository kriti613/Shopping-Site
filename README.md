# Shopping Site

An online shopping site of books with features like add to cart, view cart, login-registration page, and contact us page. 

## The page works as follows: 

1. First, the home page opens and it shows a quote to describe what the page is about and later a section to give different genre details and then what other books are available and then what exclusively is available and also some users reviews and then different authors name and the contact page. 
2. Next in the navigation bar is the product menu which displays all products with their price and stars given along with add to cart option which is visible when hovering over the product. Also on clicking the product a product detail page opens which gives different options. 
3. Next its sign-in/ sign-up page which after registering will show details on the user account page.(For all this I have used local storage)
4. Next is the view cart page will display cart products along with quantity and individual and total price respectively.
